The Simple And Nedded configuration format

## Goals

SAN aims to be a minimal data serialization format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics.
SAN is designed to map unambiguously to a hash map (a.k.a hash table).
SAN should be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.
